# plan-539-section-locator-priority Review

## Summary

Added a read-only, UI-local Section Locator Priority Readout that derives the current cue target from visible Section Locator pads, preferring the playing section, selected section, Hook, then the first available section before users edit arrangement details.

## QA

- `git diff --check` passed.
- `python3 harness/scripts/run_qa.py` passed.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `python3 harness/scripts/run_quality_gate.py` passed.
- `npm run build` passed with the existing Vite large chunk warning.
- `npm run qa` passed.
- `npm run verify` passed, including runtime smoke coverage for 14/14 sample-free blueprints and 14/14 supported style profiles.
- `npm run dev` was blocked by sandbox policy with `listen EPERM` on `127.0.0.1:5173`; escalated retry was rejected by environment policy.

## Findings

- No findings.

## Residual Risk

- Local browser/dev-server visual preview was not available because localhost binding is blocked in this environment.

## Follow-Ups

- None.
