# plan-557-arrangement-mute-map-priority-action Review

## Summary

Added a visible action button to the Arrangement Mute Map Priority Readout. The button focuses the current highest-priority mute lane through the existing Arrangement Mute Map lane-focus path, shows the existing Focus Result feedback, and preserves direct lane Focus buttons.

## QA

- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `python3 harness/scripts/run_qa.py`: passed.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `python3 harness/scripts/run_quality_gate.py`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed with the existing Vite large chunk warning.
- `npm run qa`: passed.
- `npm run verify`: passed, including runtime smoke for 14/14 sample-free blueprints and 14/14 supported style profiles.
- `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1`: sandbox run failed with `listen EPERM`; approved run started Vite at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`.
- `curl -I http://127.0.0.1:5173/`: sandbox curl could not reach the approved server; approved curl returned `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`. Browser control tooling was unavailable in this session. Dev server was stopped.

## Findings

- No findings.

## Residual Risk

- Browser visual preview was unavailable in this session, so UI verification used static QA, production build, runtime smoke, and dev-server HTTP response checks.

## Follow-Ups

- None.
