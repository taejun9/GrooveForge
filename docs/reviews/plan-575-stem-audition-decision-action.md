# plan-575-stem-audition-decision-action Review

## Summary

Added a visible action button to the Stem Audition Decision Readout. The button runs the current Full Mix or stem comparison target through the existing Stem Audition pad apply path, while preserving the pad definitions, local decision derivation, playback, export, and sample-free mix workflow.

## QA

- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `python3 harness/scripts/run_qa.py`: passed.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `python3 harness/scripts/run_quality_gate.py`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed with the existing Vite large chunk warning.
- `npm run qa`: passed.
- `npm run verify`: passed, including runtime smoke for 14/14 sample-free blueprints and 14/14 supported style profiles.
- `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1`: sandbox run failed with `listen EPERM`; approved run started Vite at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`.
- `curl -I http://127.0.0.1:5173/`: sandbox curl could not reach the approved server; approved curl returned `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`. Dev server was stopped.
- Review-time `python3 harness/scripts/run_qa.py` and `git diff --check`: passed.

## Findings

- No findings.

## Residual Risk

- Browser visual preview was not run in this session, so UI verification used static QA, production build, runtime smoke, and dev-server HTTP response checks.

## Follow-Ups

- None.
