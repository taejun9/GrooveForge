# plan-501-review-fix-preview Review

## Status

completed

## Scope

Review the Review Fix Preview update after QA.

## QA Evidence

| command | result | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `git diff --check` | pass | No whitespace errors. |
| `python3 harness/scripts/run_qa.py` | pass | Harness checks include Review Fix Preview documentation, source, and CSS expectations. |
| `python3 harness/scripts/run_quality_gate.py` | pass | Quality gate accepted the updated surface. |
| `npm run typecheck` | pass | TypeScript validation passed. |
| `npm run build` | pass | Build passed with the existing Vite large chunk warning. |
| `npm run qa` | pass | Package QA passed. |
| `npm run verify` | pass | Quality gate, runtime smoke, typecheck, and build passed; runtime smoke passed 14/14 blueprints and 14/14 style profiles. |
| `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1` | blocked | Local preview could not bind in this environment: `listen EPERM` on `127.0.0.1:5173`. Escalated retry was rejected by environment policy. |

## Findings

- No blocking findings.
- Review Fix Preview is read-only and derives only from current Review Queue summary, UI-local focused item id, local project state, and deterministic export analysis.
- The preview selects the focused fixable issue first, then the current top fixable issue, and shows a clear state when no one-step fix exists.
- Existing Fix buttons and Quick Actions Review Fix command paths still route through the existing explicit undoable handlers.
- Review Queue priority, scoring, focus results, review-fix result feedback, project schema, playback, save/load, render/export, Handoff, and sampling boundaries are unchanged.
- Browser preview remains unavailable until local dev server binding is permitted.

## Follow-Up

None required for this plan.
