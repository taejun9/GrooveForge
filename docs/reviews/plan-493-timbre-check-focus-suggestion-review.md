# plan-493-timbre-check-focus-suggestion Review

## Status

completed

## Scope

Review the Timbre Check focus suggestion update after QA.

## QA Evidence

| command | result | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `git diff --check` | pass | No whitespace errors. |
| `python3 harness/scripts/run_qa.py` | pass | Harness checks include Timbre Check focus suggestion expectations. |
| `python3 harness/scripts/run_quality_gate.py` | pass | Quality gate accepted the updated surface. |
| `npm run typecheck` | pass | TypeScript validation passed. |
| `npm run build` | pass | Build passed with the existing Vite large chunk warning. |
| `npm run qa` | pass | Package QA passed. |
| `npm run verify` | pass | Quality gate, runtime smoke, typecheck, and build passed; runtime smoke passed 14/14 blueprints and 14/14 style profiles. |
| `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1` | blocked | Local preview could not bind in this environment: `listen EPERM` on `127.0.0.1:5173`. Escalated retry was rejected by environment policy. |

## Findings

- No blocking findings.
- Timbre Check focus suggestion derives from the existing Sound Focus preview, not a new timbre-fix algorithm.
- Apply Focus requires an explicit click and routes through the existing Sound Focus pad handler.
- Timbre scoring, Sound Focus pad definitions, project schema, playback, save/load, render/export, Handoff, and sampling boundaries are unchanged.
- Browser preview remains unavailable until local dev server binding is permitted.

## Follow-Up

None required for this plan.
